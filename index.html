    <p><span class="Center-text"><u>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</u></span></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>What do you see when you close your eyes? What do you see? Undoubtedly, different things. I think you mainly see the space. But I also do not rule out the many things that are in the space, creating a kind of dialogue between the institution that is also the building and the history of this space that is inscribed in these spaces, and which are put in motion by essentially your own memory. They all eventually become just anecdotes-a kind of intangible archive, which runs parallel to the physical archive. </p>
    <br>
    <p>How do you create structure from the chaos of a collection of objects, documents, and stories?  </p>
    <br>
    <p>It is many things that speak at the same time. It is the building that speaks, as if the floor cracks open in front of your feet. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The building houses all that has happened. Behind the many layers of paint and plaster, behind the broken and rebuilt walls, under the floors, the dust in the corners...you can excavate. </p>
    <br>
    <p>What does it mean that you show things again? I would say, that we try to see through the building, the cracks in the walls, the leftovers, and see if we can establish relationships between things connected, juxtaposed, or implicated by each other that make them appear as a sort of configuration. Not to capture or nail down the history. It is a tool that provides insight into the way in which we have worked with artists. </p>
    <br>
    <p>All those sketches and discussions about production also give insight into the decision-making process. It is not only about the results- the exhibition, the printed book-but about those processes that demonstrate that a curator, artist, assistant, public enters a room at one point and says: I can see this space, this site, this work, this letter," in a different light now. </p>
    <br>
    <p>But this whole idea of accumulating everything, of establishing a sort of general archive, and making some sort of project of organizing everything and fixing it...is bound to fail. </p>
    <br>
    <p>So you will have to accept that what we have done and what we have now gathered, here, is defined by relationships between things, people, and proximities. And that is defined by its place, here, in this city. Which could be any city. But it is here. </p>
    <br>
    <p>You may ask yourselves how does this institute relate to the world, to the city? What kind of projects have artists developed about this relationship? How have they probed into the city, and how have they opened the view on political "hot potatoes"? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Especially in the early years, we interfered in the city. That had to do with the choice of directors, the way they dealt with the world, what they brought in, and how they then related the local to the global. In the first six years, there had been numerous projects that were connected to the city and engaged with the world. Many contacts and collaborations were activated. It was about making contact and bringing things from there to here and out again. </p>
    <br>
    <p>What was happening in this city at the time-politics, for example-also played a role in our exhibitions. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This city is not just a small city in a small country. It is also a harbor city, a global city, with issues beyond its physical borders... So if you move into the deeper layers of city you could see this city but also other cities, through the lenses of politics, globalism, economy, colonialism, labor. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Making the connection with the city means reaching out to it. We did a lot outside our walls. During this period, it was totally chaotic, and one could say that the city council was experimenting a little-or a lot. To find out where the city had to go, they had try things out. They tested how to make that city... and we did as well. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There are constant dynamics with the city. It always has a certain desire, or impulse, to direct the institute. How desperately the city tries-because we are a public institution and the money comes from there-to push this institute in a certain direction. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There is often a direct line to local areas and sites. Local things that we addressed. But, of course, projects are often a lens through which you look. And you can see how a city is changing. The archive shows us this. When John Knight first came here, this street was where prostitutes gathered. Around the corner was a strip club. And next door was a brothel with twelve air conditioners hanging on the facade because it was so hot inside. Those ladies inside, they needed fresh air in such a space. So in the 1980s nothing was here, and this was also one of the reasons that this location was chosen, to form a connection between parts of the city that seemed to be lost. It worked. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Every show began as an experiment. What we now call a contemporary art center was actually, when we started, a yearlong experiment. It was supposed to last one year. But after that year it continued. </p>
    <br>
    <p>All those remnants of exhibitions. Where is the basketball?! Guillaume Bijl's autographed basketball is a bit wrinkled now, but it has been here for twenty-five years. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There's also a stick from Jessica Stockholder. We have saved a lot, especially from this period. We have thrown away many things as well. Faxes were on thermal paper, so they disappear. There are things you would say now, "Why did we ever throw that away?" Contacts, letters, instructions of artists, all gone. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm go A lot disappears in the digital age. Today, many people have a clean desk policy. They want to throw everything away. So since around 2000, when we went digital, we have much less material. </p>
    <br>
    <p>And All that is never thrown away is put into a box. Some people here were very organized. But others have three or four drawers with stuff. But what is the added value of an archive? Everything is in your head, but if people want to investigate something, they need to be able to find out more about the processes and context. Are there still letters? Some people wrote everything on napkins. </p>
    <br>
    <p>An archive is not a fetish. What can be archived depends on who is looking. Are those napkins interesting? Maybe not for one but for the other yes because they really say something about the working process. And that tells another story about an exhibition, people, and relationships. Correspondences with others, certain decisions...That provides a very good insight into how creative processes operate, but also shows the practical, everyday character of an institute. </p>
    <br>
    <p>If you want to tell your story in a certain way, then making specific selections is essential, and it is also important to place your archive within an institution that knows how to deal with it. How you look at the material and how to archive also determines where you can bring it. For example, there is an A4 sheet with a discussion about artist's fees. And this is very much an issue today. "Should artists, or should they not, receive fees?" "Is this important?" "How much?" </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><span class="Center-text"><u>SCARS</u></span></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The whole building is marked by scars, from work, from people... All these ghosts still swarm around, conversing with all the other works that came after them. </p>
    <br>
    <p>And that began with the exhibitions by Guillaume Bijl and John Knight. Thinking through the entire program, I know exactly where they are, these scars. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I can give you ten examples on the second floor. It starts when you enter: the floor cracks there, as if you are walking on ice. That is because of Guillaume Bijl's installation. Because...we were in a hurry, and the installation of that show had to happen while we were still laying the floor, and since then that floor has never been right. Nobody knows it's there, but it is. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The second scar I can identify too. John Knight was there in that room at the left, on the street-facing side of the building, and he had a work there that went across the room diagonally. Ten spirit levels. We had bought some of them, but two belonged to my father. We had taped them to the floor with double-sided tape, and then, at the opening, a visitor taps his foot against one level, and that tape was so awfully strong that this little kick made a big hole in the floor. One big piece snapped off, creating a scar. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Jessica Stockholder created a huge work with bathtubs. And one of those bathtubs simply had to go through a wall. Look, here in this wall. With floodlighting, you can still see the holes it made. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In these walls, in their cracks and crevices, is the real archive. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Jessica Stockholder may have left the building, but over there is a part of her, hidden in the wall. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Herman Pitz had done something with the electrical cables that are normally hidden inside the walls. He wanted to expose the cables to the exterior and for us to remove all the stucco so the viewer would see the enclosed power lines-that was part of his piece. Now we have placed a wall in front of this, but it's still there. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Walls are now in front of that rear facade, and they all cover the windows as well. The heaters are behind there too, so the whole wall is heated. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There, a swing was once hung from the ceiling. You can still see it. It was a work by Irene Fortuyn. You could swing up and down in the space, and while doing this, you would see the windows of the houses at the other end of the courtyard. She asked all the residents to hang flower containers with red flowers from their windowsills. The flowers are gone now, but I still see them if I think of this. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This floor alone you can already analyze in this way. Is this fiction? Or fact? If there's no longer anything in that space is the story still unfolding? How does the memory work? What does it produce? Memory creates, through telling a story as I do now, a chain of events that may become tradition. And that passes on from generation to generation. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the room, front left, where John Knight's work caused that hole in the floor, Ludger Gerdes made his paintings, in thick oil paint, directly on the wall, and when I say thick, I mean really thick. Perhaps five centimetres thick. At the end of the exhibition, the work had to go. These big pimples of paint were partly removed, as much as we could. We repaired the wall with a top layer of primer, which was then smoothly plastered, but underneath, Ludger's work is still there. </p>
    <br>
    <p>So then, at some point-quite a few years later-a young artist named Brian Jungen arrived, and he wanted to create a sort of cave art, right on that wall. With a grinder, he made these almost primitive drawings on the wall, milled into the plaster. That was a hell of a job because it was the same wall as Ludger Gerdes's painting, and if you are milling into old oil paint, you get a kind of jawbreaker effect. </p>
    <br>
    <p>So in that space you could see, very beautifully, those old layers of Ludger Gerdes. Archaeology, but also a kind of imperceptible archive. Rita McBride also grinned holes, but in the floor, laying bare the layers underneath the linoleum, right through to the concrete. Those floors had been there for a long time. People walked over it continuously, and it looked like traces of the many footsteps of those who had set foot in this building. But they were not-it was a constructed archaeology. The traces gone now, covered by a new floor. </p>
    <br>
    <p>You can see the leftovers of an object or part of an artwork, but you may not always understand its context. If I tell you these stories, they start to unfold and assume a life of their own. So then, suddenly, there is something to see. In that sense, I think that space is never empty. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Of course, this is all mere speculation and all very imaginative. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Billy Apple® wanted the kitchen and workshop removed, to bring the space back to its original state. So we did and then recreated all the of the building's old traces. Everything had to look so sleek! This building is an old school from 1874-where all sorts of things happened. Then-and this is very unusual-we meticulously closed all the holes and eliminated the cracks in this old building. If you look carefully, you will see these differences that otherwise go unnoticed. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This is a house of stories... </p>
    <br>
    <p>To detail all these stories is to begin to imagine how one form is overlaid by what succeeds it, while leaving traces and scars in layers on the body of the building, on its experience. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Maria Anna de Wees is a German artist. We had, at one time, artist editions that remained in the building. And there, on the two end walls, she had made two eyes. The two eyes are still there, located exactly at eye height. Two eyes embedded in the stucco, you can still see them if you look carefully. If we uncover them they would be able to see us again...</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p><span class="Center-text"><u>CLOUDS</u></span></p>
   <br>
   <br>
    <p>Witte de With, the namesake of the institution and the street it sits on, was a naval hero. The first years were stormy. The street was not what it is now. There were nightclubs and barflies and the city wanted to do basically anything to change this. </p>
    <br>
    <p>So we started thinking from these given facts-the naval hero, the sea, and the clouds. And rain. The cloud is a cumulus cloud. From this you can expect everything: rain, hail, art, and what not. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Initially, there was only the cloud, and in its first appearance, the cloud was more important than the context. But it is a symbol. It is also a form, it is a very powerful figure. One cannot deny that it is a cloud-something that would exist only temporarily, because Witte de With would be a temporary experiment. </p>
    <br>
    <p>A cloud, airy but black. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Black. A black cloud is ominous. And art is ominous. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Such a black cloud... one does not know what happens. That is strong. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It is something "uncanny." The shape of things to come, a cloud hanging. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Witte de With was something completely new, with a very different potential than art spaces that already existed, so it had to be different. The cloud has helped. It is not the cause, but it did help. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It is a public institution, but it was certainly in the early years also a network situation in which art was a private matter and the "funding" was as well. A lot of collectors flocked to the openings. Gifts from collectors were easily given, works were lent, and a type of game was happening, continuously, to push artists to the front, who would then do better on the market. Because if an artist has a large exhibition at "Witte de With" then, of course, the price of the work rises. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first identity of the cloud remained virtually unchanged until 2004, so it had functioned for ten years. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The newest iteration of cloud is downright bad. No more threat from this form, no rain, no hail, no storm. It's too sweet. It is neither beautiful nor ugly. But it does not have to be because the institution itself has changed. </p>
    <br>
    <p>What is the substantive reason for a cuddly cloud? </p>
    <br>
    <p>When the first cloud was developed, web culture did not quite exist yet. This new cloud strongly recalls the cloud of Apple, the iCloud.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The first sketches imagined the cloud of the weather forecast. Eventually it evolved into the cumulus form: high, menacing, and flattened at the top. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It was a cloud. And with that old black cloud, one can interpret the image directly. It is a cloud, it is not a sheep, and it's not a turd. It is a cloud. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first cloud is really the thundercloud. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We looked for different ways we could give it new life. Different forms. </p>
    <br>
    <p>If you want to develop identity further then you should cherish the essence that is recognized. You should not throw that overboard. "We have the cloud, we should not move away from it." </p>
    <br>
    <p>So we "saved" the original cloud, but brought in... the notion of development as a dynamic concept. It can be a summer cloud... but it can also be a very dark heavy cloud. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We finally arrived at a cloud that was already there, and we understood it in such a way that it is to a certain extent what the institution stands for. It stands for the center, it stands for the place, for the people who work there. We were looking for a logic to the cloud in such a way that it would always be different. An image that is continuously changing but remains the same. An image that contains a constant recognizability. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There are many interpretations about what the cloud could suggest. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In pictures of sea battles of Witte de With, you see ships with cannons and clouds in the background. The cloud could also stand for explosive ideas. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We never thought about giving it new meaning. We made use of the original. It is a very strong image. It is subtle and silent; it is intellectual and theoretical. It becomes a kind of protest. Activist. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It was important that the cloud returned in a new disguise. In whatever form. </p>
    <br>
    <p>What is a cloud? A...dream?! </p>
    <br>
    <p>Will this cloud just hover? Drift? Where are irs borders? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Art is never one vision. There are always pluralities and multiple insights. If you put all the shapes on top of each other, you get a very different picture. </p>
    <br>
    <p>At that point, the changeover, the shift, that took place was related to the program and the exhibition. That was where the overlapping of the different clouds came from.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>For each part of the program layers were superimposed. So the cloud changed again and again and again. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It reflected how the institution worked. In the beginning, we did not know what the program would be. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The plurality, the variations of the cloud were also how the program developed thereafter. Multiple directions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Does the cloud come first, and then the program, or does the program generate the cloud? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Drawing... going back to the line. Away from the heaviness, to something that can be continuously redefined. At a certain point, it was only one line. And from there we continued to analyze forms to find the appearance of a cloud. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Anyone can draw a cloud. And because anyone can draw a cloud, you can play with the idea that there really is an archetype, a form that can be thought of by anyone. When layering all these over each other, new visions of a cloud come together as a new form.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first cloud is firm. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Look at the clouds that follow: they are fragile, or vulnerable, or variable. This overlaying, layer upon layer, is creating a form of archaeology. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The choice to make the cloud eventually transparent is, of course, an important difference compared to the black cloud. It relates to the desire for transparency. In politics, in society, there was an urgent call for transparency, so that everybody would understand what something was. So that everyone could understand what art is, what was going on, who everybody else is. But transparency does not exist. Saying that everything should be clear, visible, for everyone to see, this creates a false sense of understanding, of access, of visibility. And so these new series of clouds reflect what was going on. False transparency, confusion, plurality. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The latest cloud is friendly, easier, and more accessible. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The latest cloud wants to be "playful." But the playfulness is a misunderstanding. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It may look sweet, accessible, recognizable, but it is more corporate. Even if very accessible, it is a super-stylized symbol. A standard sign. An iconic symbol. The simplest design you can make. So that is why the playfulness is false. As with the sweet, funny icons in our smartphones: they look friendly, like something to play with, but behind these super cute symbols are not-so-cute corporations. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There should be multiple clouds again after this. So that you are going to review the institution again after a few years because the identity has changed, and continues to change. </p>
    <br>
    <p>To see what works. If it still works. If it still fits.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Examining the evolution of the logo could be understood as "institutional critique." First, there was the basic black cloud, and then several variations of that first cloud appeared. Then, in the third iteration, it became important keep the cloud as a logo, as a motive.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We approached the cloud as something continuous, something that could I grow and change. Sometimes it is good that it is more an evolution than a completely different entity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Looking at the original cloud, and then at the next stage of the design, we saw a lot of confusion. It was no longer easily recognizable as a cloud. It looked more like a very rainy day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our idea was a cloud as a group of things. A group of people, a group of artists, a variation of politics and layers. To create more dimensions. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We made a radical translation of the first cloud. A simplified version. In the 1990s, communication happened in a different way than it does now. We could not travel that quickly, "online" did not exist. These changes in communication needed to be reflected in an update of the cloud. It is more about visual identity now than it was back in those days.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is very important to see the cloud grow and take on a life of its own, to add new chapters to its story. </p>
    <br>
    <p>When one is drawing clouds, it is crucial to understand what makes them recognizable as a cloud or not. To visualize, one must start sketching. We did pages and pages of clouds, in ink. Thought clouds, or like clouds of gas, rather than a cloud in the sky.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The cloud has moved from an almost completely autonomous logo to a much more accessible and friendly cloud. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first cloud was a terrifying one, especially the full black version. How the logo evolved runs parallel to the cultural climate in the arts and to how this institution is forced to meet the expectations of more transparency, to be more audience-friendly. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The changes in the cloud illustrate that change of climate and that change of expectations.</p>

      <p><span class="bold-text">Tracing the Past, Shaping the Future: Bik Van der Pol's Experimental Reflection on Rotterdam's Art and Witte de With Exhibition.</span></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Following our twenty-fifth anniversary, I invited Bik Van der Pol to work with us on creating a temporary institute-one that would bring in and reimagine perspectives on the city of Rotterdam through Witte de With and vice versa. It would be born from their practice and their observations of Witte de With's exhibition history and her evolution within the political context of the city, and, unlike the many other museums in Rotterdam, it would not omit the lineage of critically engaged, international contemporary artistic practices from the (art) history of the city-a task that I felt could only be entrusted to them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Rijksmuseum-in-rebuilding<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">1</span><span class="footnote">Bik Van der Pol Fly Me To The Moon. Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (6 October-19 November 2006).</span></sup> Bik Van der Pol had watched Witte de With develop since its inception in 1990 with every new director's arrival in Rotterdam. They paid close attention to the socioeconomic and political contexts in which the institution operated. They would be the perfect interlocutors for weaving and interfacing inbetween, drawing on resources from both in and out of the institution's walls.</p>
      <br>
      <p>On our end, an institutional spring-cleaning was in order; no one had yet dared to dig into our drawers and servers. As such, we set a growing collection in motion, tracing previously unorganized in-house materials while hoping to honor their extended networks at and around Witte de With. First, we identified in our storage project-related leftovers from our rich exhibition history. We then tread slowly through accumulations of primary source material, such as correspondences, artists' documents, and sketches from artists, curators, and installation team By inviting artists to enact an institutional imagination exercise with and Through our institution, our desire was not only to work together to catalogue what might otherwise become lost in both the history of the institution and art's history in chwhere the institution is located but also to embark on a survey with Bik Van of the politics of accumulation-through a possible exposé of the results of the sincere and honest research.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Bik Van der Pol agreed and had carte blanche to follow their own drives and urges. They interviewed artists, staff, and graphic designers. They pored over our bookshelves and boxes, rified through our basement, and uncovered the cracks in our 140-year-old building/They worked with our team dedicated to their research, a process they approached from myriad angles, with various methods and steady progress. They spoke to anyone with whom they wished about the institute's history and did so as subjectively as possible. Theirs was a rather "global" endeavor. In exchange, the institution would serve as the vessel for their memories and private conversations, which were distilled into a script that informed boin the exhibition and this publication. Lastly, they wished to assemble fragments and traces of artworks related to their memory and to our deputy director's twenty-five years of stories They would approach this endeavor as a site-sensitive preject, diving into exhibitions and initiatives that were otherwise unlikely to be re-visited as the issues and urgencies they negotiated have disappeared from the city's physical and temporal landscapes. They hunted down seemingly on-the-fringes material- support structures, plans, notes, stories, and witness reports-and were not afraid to equate these remnants with artworks. So in their words, "document" became "art" and "art" became "source material." Theirs was an exercise in collecting as well as in staging-though by no means pornographic. It would be an anti-exhibition statement where evidence was laid bare but with a careful resistance. They surveyed the institution's physical space and embarked on countless dialogues with its exhibition history, in turn re-activating the work of many artists but also the many methods those artists had undertaken over the decades. I will refrain from listing here the many artists, articles, documents, or works given the breadth of traces, fragments, and correspondences revealed.

      <p>This exhibition serves as a poignant case study and a baseline for-if not an introduction to-a remarkable chapter in history: the intellectual expansion of the 1980s and its unfolding through the 1990s to the early 2000s. Bik Van der Pol's emphasis on the first decade of Witte de With's existence not only drew from the comfort of the distance of time but also reinvigorated the palpable connection to the local through the problems artists of that era confronted, be it drugs, prostitution, or the city's economic dependency on the harbor and the European Union. Then, Rotterdam's complications were all on display, extremely visible, and not as structurally imbedded, politically imposed, or seemingly imperceptible as they are today. Or, let us now ask, were they really so visible?</p>

      <p><u>It makes the following attempts:</u>
        <br>
        <br>1. To unpack the tension between the contemporary and the record. 
        <br>2. To consider the "collection and display of traces" experiment from a broader point of view of contemporary art (and its discontents) and to offer a critical take on the methodology of the equal treatment of art, trace, and document. 
        <br>3. To treat this experiment not only as a manifestation of a symptom of the auto-immune disorders of a contemporary art institute per se but as a global phenomenon with a historical trajectory across disciplines, with a focus on this moment in time. 
        <br>4. To inform, as the institution embarks on its next chapter, from 2018 onward.</p>

        <br>
             <p>Since we began working together, we have been very much aware of not adding to this stream of the "new." We would rather engage with some sort of reorganization of what already is-selecting something from the stream of things and through a process of unfolding and unraveling, unlocking hidden information in objects and bodies of knowledges and assumptions. When we begin to work with a situation and its context, we first take an outside perspective. What emerges from such a site-specific and site-sensitive approach?

For Photosynthesis, Tue Greenfort asked Witte de With to switch its power supply to an environmentally friendly provider for the duration of his exhibition. Subsequent correspondence with energy supplier ENECO (presented in the exhibition) reveals the consequences involved in such a change. His project explores corporate social responsibility and aspects of value in energy production: "green" energy is technically not worth more than "gray" energy, but its extra costs are due to energy being now a "product" on the free market. The electricity used by Witte de With would remain, in fact, unchanged, but ENECO would buy energy from sustainable sources. After much discussion, it proved to be impossible to switch the institution to green energy for the six weeks of the exhibition, but for 2007, ENECO offered to make the switch and reimburse Witte de With for its extra costs.

For The Part In The Story Where A Part Becomes A Part Of Something Else, the sculpture Two Rectangles Vertical Gyratory (1971) by George Rickey, was laid down in parts by Bik Van der Pol on the floor of the second floor exhibition spaces. Rickey's kinetic sculpture, previously installed on Rotterdam's Binnenwegplein, has a turbulent history. After renovations of the square and the addition of a fountain in 2012 the ground level was raised and the blades of the sculpture rotated. at a mere 2.11 meters above street level. The sculpture was considered a safety hazard because of the danger of it hitting the passersby. To prevent this, the sculpture was initially fenced off and finally removed later that same year. Sculpture International Rotterdam (SIR), which owns the sculpture, and the maintenance department of the city attempted to find a solution in close conversation with the artist's estate, which was created after Rickey passed away in 2002. In April 2015, the work finally returned to its original location, now on a fifty-five-centimeter tall plinth. However, in November of that same year, the sculpture had to be removed again. A large truck had hit and severely damaged the sculpture's metal wings. To this day, the work is in storage, waiting to be repaired and re- installed.

Ken Lum's 1990 exhibition included Melly Shum Hates Her Job (1989), a photograph of a disheveled young woman sitting in a cramped office. "HATES" is written in vibrating red, indicating Melly's frustration. Lum was asked to remake a work in billboard form for display on Witte de Withstraat; this billboard became popularly known as "Melly Shum." After the work was taken down in January 1991, Witte de With staff received several telephone calls and written statements demand- ing Melly Shum's reinstatement. One caller, asked why it was important, reasoned that every city needs a mon- ument to the problem of hating one's job. The work was reinstalled, and since then Melly Shum has become much more than a landmark for the people of Rotterdam: she exists as a dynamic symbol of the relationship between Witte de With and the wider world. For a short while in 2005, during Lukas Einsele's exhibition One Step Beyond, Melly Shum was replaced by a photograph of a young minesweeper, Deminer working on a hill, Afghanistan, 04.11.2002 (2005). Then, one night, someone added the sentence "Omar hates his job" below the photo in typed-out letters. A powerful addition, and a beautiful response.</span></sup> For example, the first place one would enter the city is Rotterdam Centraal station. That station in 1990 was quite different from what it is today. There was a square in front of the station called Perron Nul that was mainly populated by drug addicts and homeless people.

Eugenio Dittborn is known for his Airmail Paintings that he sends around the world via Fedex. For his first major retrospective he realized La Casa de Erasmo de Rotterdam [The House of Erasmus of Rotterdam] (1993) in collaboration with drug addicts who frequented the Perron Nul (Platform Zero), a methadone clinic and safe ha- ven located next to Rotterdam Centraal from 1987 to 1994. Perron Nul was an initiative of Reverend Hans Visser, who served as a mediator between the junkies and the city council. Dittborn wanted to work with the junkies of Per- ron Nul (however, it is rumored that he only visited them once). Jack van Mild- ert, a former art student who had set up creative projects with the homeless drug addicts, was his contact at Perron Nul. Dittborn's project focused on the definition of house and home, and asked addicts to create drawings in response to two questions: "What does your ideal home look like? What did the house you lived in when you were ten years old look like?" He reinterpreted their answers into huge drawings. The airmail envelopes were placed on the floor and newspapers were added to the drawings every day. The exhibition arrived in envelopes, and returned in envelopes.

Our aim was-and is-not to be didactic. We are emphasizing the potential of storytelling.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">Why are those stories important to tell? </blockquote>
        <br> 
            <p>Because through telling stories, creating and sharing imagination is unleashed. The value of "learning" is "in practice." When looking back at all these projects by artists and Witte de With, we realized during the preparatory process that the Rotterdam city government was experimenting in an unprecedented way, especially during the early 1990s when Witte de With was founded. It seemed everything was on loose ground, because the whole city (the city of Rotterdam as a site, as a place, city as the municipality) was one big experiment. We learned that Witte de With has begun as a yearlong experiment. After that year, the institution would be evaluated, but instead it just continued.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">5</span><span class="footnote">5. Lawrence Weiner placed the words "AS LONG AS IT LASTS" on the Euromast (an observation tower in Rotterdam) as part of the exhibition of the same title at Witte de With in which nine artists were invited to make works that took painting as a source of ref- erence. The words-each letter mea- sured four meters tall, with the com- plete text painted over a height of sixty meters passed from the inside to the outside and showed the transition from painting to everyday reality. To Weiner, language has limitless possibilities, contrary to, for example, a painting whose limits of (re)presentation always end at the edge of the frame. His texts often describe a movement, action or process, no fixed form, as a performative sculpture that comes alive in the minds of the spectators when they are read or heard. A badge with the same text was produced in an edition of one thousand, available at for five guilders. AS LONG AS IT LASTS (12 June-19 September 1993).</span></sup> By experimenting and by just doing, they learned a lot during this process. It was actually very interesting to discover this, because from the outside, Witte de With has always been seen as an elitist, mythic institution. Through storytelling, history can be visualized and experienced without becoming didactic.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">6</span><span class="footnote">6. By creating depictions of fictitious histories, Eleanor Bond reinvents the genre of the historical tableau. Cosmoville reactivated the nearly lost tradition of commissioning painters to visually record the development and expansion of cities. Speculating on the outcome of continual reconstructions and transformations, Bond painted a possible future history of Rotterdam, in saturated, unnatural colors and from an unrealistic, aerial perspective, with titles such as On the Maasvlakte Extension, Rotterdam Establishes a Satellite Colony which Functions as a Prosthetic Eye and Arm. The paintings were developed during a six-month research and production period in Rotterdam in 1995. The visual sources for the painting were photographs taken during a flight over Rotterdam, Maasvlakte and the surrounding areas, with pilot Ariadne Urlus, team member at Witte de With who took flying les- sons especially for this project.

        <blockquote class="styled-question">Nostalgia can be tempting. The past has a charming veneer, and there is a material charm that comes with any archive.

        <br>
            <p>If one is too attached to the charm of old material, one might end up with an attractive exhibition of quite pretty things. But-and this goes back to the relationship of Witte de With as a site within the city as a site-it is not about a desire to return to what has been done. During discussions at Witte de With, a writer was constantly referring to how nice Rotterdam was before it changed and became gentrified. Is this nostalgia or a glorification of the past? Well, often many people do not really know what Rotterdam was like in the 1980s and 1990s. Boarded up. Poor. We do not know what Dittborn saw when he entered the city. But looking through Dittborn's correspondences, we can see many things, one of them being that he was more interested in what he wanted to make as an artist (as he stated himself) than in the homeless people he was working with. Opening boxes also allows the possibility to "annotate." That is a practice. Dennis Adams's project Afwerkplek for small cars in the tippelzone, the red-light district, was an objet trouvé.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">7</span><span class="footnote">7. With Afwerkplek for small cars (2001), Dennis Adams designed an enclosed playroom for preschool children, based on Rotterdam's afwerkplek, a drive-in facility located an industrial zone at the edge of the city that accommodated prostitution. A typical product of the Dutch tendency to box social problems into a strict spatial order, the afwerkplek included well-lit sidewalks for the prostitutes, driving lanes for customers, numbered drive-in cubicles for the action, and beautified with a set of red bins for the waste. By using the existing facility as a model for a playground, Adams test- ed the limits of democratic tolerance by absorbing the prostitution area into the symbolic world of children. Hortus Conclusus/Breeze of Air (29 April-1 July 2001).</span></sup>
          He worked with this site because it fascinated him. This has nothing to do with nostalgia, but more with looking at the issues at stake and determining how examples from the past speak to each other. Preparing this project-which we see as a work-using leftovers that sometimes are art objects, but often not, "art as a practice of thinking" was set in motion. It is fascinating how these processes grow and are generated by the leftovers.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">8</span><span class="footnote">8. Arena (1997) is a monumental modular sculpture by Rita McBride that invites the viewer to interact. The remainder of this work, a model and prototype of its system, recalls the action by REST, an initiative of Rotterdam-based artists. While Arena was installed for a long period of time, it was not often used, contrary to the artist's intention. REST activated McBride's work by distributing a card inviting the public to use the arena as a public space, based on the model of the Socratic walk: talking, walking, sitting. A conversation on the uses of art was moderated by philosopher Maaike Engelen. When one of the curators heard about this (non-official) action, he threathened to call the police to prevent this event from happening, but actually could not since the public entered the space by paying the regular entrance fee.

Buren invited eight artists to participate an exhibition an "abstract" space. his letter of invitation-dated 23 August 1994 and included Cahier 2-he concealed the name and location of the exhibition space as well as the title of the exhibition, simply stating that "a well-known exhibition space" to which the artist was being invited would host the show.

        <br>
          <p>It can be detrimental if memories glorify the past, if they only celebrate or confirm the greatness of the subject of research-Witte de With, its history, its name, the myth created through continuously changing directors. In general, a "self- celebratory glorification of a past is destructive, because it excludes. Throughout the making of the exhibition, we were all very aware of this. Paul van Gennip, Deputy Director since 1990, for instance, would ask, "Why are we doing this?" Demythologizing may be a consequence of this operation. An artist may just want to make his work while only establishing the impression of social engagement. Directors may fight with artists or politicians over futilities.

The cut trunk is a leftover from the work Two Trees by Cildo Meireles. One tree was installed inside Witte de With while an other was placed outside on a square nearby. The branches on the tree at Witte de With hung out of one of the windows, through the façade, and onto the street. The rest of the tree- the trunk-was inside. And where you would normally find the roots, there were thousands of matches sticking out. With thousands of matches together, you have a potential bomb. If you light them, you can set the house. on fire. For the second tree Cildo made small leaves from punched out sheets of paper that were to be scattered around the trunk of the tree.

          <p>We applied, as a critical tool, a sense of humour or a sense of irony. By selecting leftovers that have absolutely no value at all, that are not presented or even considered as artworks but may have another value. By presenting artworks as documents. By not establishing a hierarchy between objects. By using the structure of open shelves so that people could touch the objects if they wanted to, so that they could sort through the leaflets and papers, pick up models, bottles, or leaves lying on the floor. We acknowledged that objects might be stolen, but we did not treat the leftovers of Wire de With's past as precious objects, though some were singular objects.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">12</span><span class="footnote">12. Basing his work on the interplay between the material object and its context, John Knight comments on the mutually determined meaning of cultural object and cultural space. Levels (1969), consisting of an arrangement of used carpenter's levels from (and returned to) the Witte de With workshop or the private homes of some members of the installation team, refers to the basic, reduced shapes of minimal sculpture; yet it foregrounds interchanges between the objects and the physical setting.

The newspapers got all messy and stained; the currency of the day became yesterday's paper. Showing decay, that which passes away. There was a discussion during installation of the Paul Thek show 1992 whether Thek's work had to be remade using newspapers from 1970s, or newspapers of the day.

        <br>
          <p>Quite methodologically.

For example, 1993, the Rotterdam Arts Council proposed to realize Children's Pavilion, a project conceived by Dan Graham and Jeff Wall 1987. It brought together Graham's architectural investigations and Wall's pictorial analyses. After earlier attempts to make the project happen several cities in the United States and France failed, the event AIR Alexander 1993 became the perfect context to finally build the pavilion Alexander- polder. The structure was to be made of reflective glass, featuring interactive educational tools that treated children as active citizens. Due to the lack of support, the Children's Pavilion project was abandoned 1994 and to this day remains unrealized. Plans were made to build another pavilion by Dan Graham, possibly even on the roof of Witte de With. Scale models were made as an artist's edition to finance the project.

The show revealed the artist's many influences, such as Brazil's Neo-Concrete movement and the color theory of Piet Mondrian. It also demonstrate Oiticica's reconsideration of Oswald de Andrade, whose Anthropophagous Manifesto (1928) remains a model for postcolonial subjectivity that creatively consumes the myriad influences of the (mainly Western) world rather than being consumed by them. During a period when the relational aspects of contemporary art were under considerable artistic scrutiny, Oiticica's insistence on the participation of the spectator, his love for the unpredictable poetry of the street, and his celebration of the festive character of the samba proved seminal. Witte de With produced an exhibition script for this travelling show, as a support and manual for each new instalment of the show.

The Rotterdam Project took place at both Witte de With and Hoeksche Waard, an area that was at that time assigned for the city's need to expand. This project was an attempt to realize an exhibition that functioned as a place for dialogue instead of spectacle and asked whether publicity can be more than just information. Craigie Horsfield wanted to contemplate the city different terms, believing that through a process of communal thinking and dialogue an image of the city would evolve, based on the specific and personal experiences of the participants relation to other people. He made large black and white photographs of all the people involved on both sites. The Rotterdam Project was concerned with self-investigation. The institute was looking at itself, how it functions, how it collaborates, what its relationships are, who performs what roles. Actors from the theatre group Hollandia trans- formed all these questions in relation to theatre. Translating discussions and thoughts into scripts about the city as a place of experience, in which the public was invited to participate.

If we consider the bombing of the Rotterdam in 1940, still visible in traces inscribed throughout the city, the first rupture, then the rupture in Rotterdam's political sphere in 2002 is a second drastic turn-the enormous impact of the rise of the politician Pim Fortuyn, and his murder that same year. The way the city experienced his death, how it served as a platform for mourning, how people channeled their collective anger. All these events upended Rotterdam's self-image and political reality. And also, because of this political situation, Witte de With, as an institution in Rotterdam, had to question its own existence.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">18</span><span class="footnote">18. Public art institutions receiving state funding need to raise about one-fourth of their income from private sources, especially after the government severely cut the budget for arts and culture in 2011. To meet this requirement, Witte de With has organized annual benefit evenings with De Appel. The first benefit took place in 2012 in Atelier van Lieshout; the second in 2013, at the floating Sea Palace in Amsterdam. These events featured an auction of artworks organized by Christie's. One of the auctioned lots was the staged choreography performed by the two institution's directors, as conceived by Greek-Swiss choreographer Alexandra Bachzetsis. Defne Ayas and Ann Demeester were asked to look alike as much as possible. They were not only asked to truthfully respond to a list of fundamental questions posed by Bachzetsis in a video interview but also fulfil the final requirement: to "stage" themselves before the gathered crowd. Ayas' staging of herself took the form of a dance to the beats of a top-charting Nigerian pop song, followed by Demeester's response to artist Hassan Khan's music. Their performance was purchased for €4500 by Dutch designer Jurgen Bey.</span></sup>This is reflected in our research into the logo-the cloud-where it came from, how it went through different stages after the turn of the century, and how the development of this logo goes hand in hand with the development of the institution through time.</p>

One could compare the construction of Maasvlakte 2, the most recent extension of the Port of Rotterdam, to that of the builders of the Trans- continental Railroad in the United States. The construction of this railway, and the point where the eastern and western parts met was crucial for the choice of the location for artist Robert Smithson's work Spiral Jetty (1970). The construction of the Transcontinental Railroad directly influenced this work. For Maasvlakte 2, land was created by the construction of a sea- wall, with a beach, dunes, stone, and concrete blocks. To do so, sand was removed from the sea. Bik Van der Pol followed this process closely in their research on the poetics of "making" (poiesis), exploring similarities be- tween the creation of a work of art and creating new land, asking, "What role do poetics and aesthetics play in large economic, infra-structural processes?" Following the Maasvlakte 2's borders from above in a helicopter, Bik Van der Pol filmed the creation of this new land, mapping its formation. What ultimately led to the final design of the land is made tangible in the experience of time and space. Bik Van der Pol, Facts on the Ground, 2010.</span></sup>
        If we had another year to work, we would have liked to add the voices of people outside Witte de With. Referring to the demographic development of the city of Rotterdam, already during the 1990s it was apparent that the city is very young and ethnically mixed. Using the format of an exhibition as a tool to address and articulate learning and to create and think within this dynamic context is something that we or others could engage with as a next step. What are the foundations of this institution then, now, and in the future? Gerard Hadders, the designer of Witte de With's first logo-the black cloud-was very specific in his analysis of the institution through its logo in the exhibition scripts. The logo is an image of the institute, a vehicle. It is not only branding but also a continuously changing platform of what was, is, and becomes of the institution.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">You create a script, a theatrical device that serves a theatrical purpose. Were the scripts premeditated or did you write what turned out to be a script?</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>We did write a preliminary form of a script beforehand, as a communication device between ourselves and between us and others, like a discussion piece. Then this script developed over time into a format that could become a text to accompany the exhibition. We always work with some sort of script, because otherwise there is no material for us to engage with. We are invited to go, observe, and act. Working collaboratively also implies a script (though not one that is prescribed). The methodology of a script as a tool to work is productive for us. A script is like the dialogue you have to articulate to each other, to speculate on what something could be. So the "script-ness" is present in the conceptual phase, because it is like a form of organization: to write everything down in order not to forget, to ensure that there is something that we can work with. The script in the exhibition, presented as a voiceover, was developed in dialogue with many people, especially with Paul, who, in a way, is the living archive of the institute.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">Often the script is what is left behind. It comes into existence through what you gather and then dissipate, but the script remains.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Working with things that will disappear after being exposed could be interpreted as a political choice-that nobody owns the work because it is about imagination, process, and change. It is inhabited by the experience of the moment. It happens and cannot exclusively belong to someone, in the sense of "owned" or "acquired." Our work does not align with the normal operations of the art market. We mostly work with public institutions, because "public" implies access. And our exhibition at Witte de With is not ours exclusively. Anybody who went through the shelves, experienced whatever they thought was interesting or necessary, and spent a little or a long time with the work. The work resides in their imagination. New scars. Other traces.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">To me, WERE IT AS IF shows the methodology of the system of working. 1 am very impressed with the way that operates, because it demonstrates the power of speech and the agency that things have even when you change them, when you flip them around and show a different face. They speak even more than they would on their own or in their original sense. The work is a double-sided coin, and the exhibition succeeds in showing the double-sided nature of things. Then, of course, as you said, the material in the exhibition does not belong to a real archive and all the objects within are hybrid objects. Are we fetishizing things too much or not enough, or how much information or contextualization should be given to these things? Can they survive? We, the institution, did offer context, and I think we ended up doing something that worked on different levels: one very much informative, other levels more formal or associative or playful. WERE IT AS IF offered a spectacular setup but, perhaps, a disguise as well. It was very quiet or subdued but, at the same time, very loud and crowded. There were a lot of voices speaking, literally and figuratively, and it was the task of the viewer to trace these stories as nothing spoke in a dominant way. 
          <br>Also, through making this exhibition, an archive was created where previously there was none, so in a sense, I think that archive-making was a parallel activity to making the exhibition. It then became a very functional tool because we could engage with the material for longer. If we didn't have the mess to begin with, but rather an organized structure, the outcome would have been very different. I don't think we could have done what we did from a preexisting, organized archive.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>This brings us to the design of the cloud. We think it should be redesigned again and again, not only as a logo but also as a conceptual tool, a manifest, a medium, and as a connection between the physicality of the space of the institution to its digital, cybernetic manifestation. It would be like the door one opens to go to the exhibitions, and then there's another door to open but in another way, one that can be navigated differently. We think that is a real challenge. </p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">Looking back at twenty-seven years of Witte de With, exhibiting has not changed much. Many things have changed, of course, but the way we are exhibiting remains the same. Do you think it should change? In a way, WERE IT AS IF was also a very traditional, library-style means of display.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Yes and no, I don't know. Though in five years I doubt exhibiting will be very different from what it is today. Other voices that may have been overlooked will certainly appear, which will incorporate other views and experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question"> We talked a lot about containers of knowledge and how Witte de With could be seen as a knowledge base. Of course, we are not a museum, so it's Interesting for us to negotiate the kind of responsibility that comes with this because we are not there for the future. We are not there to preserve art from the now for posterity. We are there to exhibit it in the present and then show something else. How do you interpret the responsibility that comes with an archive with regard to an art centre like Witte de With?</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Witte de With's responsibility so far has been to show contemporary art and contemporary thinking and practices that understand themselves as art and inform art. That has been the practice Witte de With was founded on and a practice that takes place mainly in art spaces like it. But even if it doesn't take place in those spaces, even if we deny it, the practice occurs elsewhere.<sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">21</span><span class="footnote">21. In 1962, artist Barrie Bates changed his name to Billy Apple®. The survey of his practice unfolded in three parts. A History of the Brand traced the development of the artist into a registered trademark, through which he blurred boundaries between art and commerce, individual and brand. For Revealed/Concealed, the architecture of Witte de With's exhibition and maintenance spaces was altered, with the relocation of the kitchen from a second-floor passage to the library on the first floor of the building and a radical cleaning of the entire space. In the re-symmetrized exhibition space, Billy Apple®'s particular brand of institutional critique was made visible, while the exhibition covered its own tracks, as it is unlikely that new visitors recognized this change to the exhibition spaces. The artist's "subtraction" remains in place to this day. As part of the exhibition a large text-based billboard facing the main exit of Rotter- dam Central Station was installed that read: THE ARTIST HAS TO LIVE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE Billy Apple®, 1985 (2009). Today this is the location of The Wow®, the largest commercial LED screen in the Netherlands, used to advertise big international brands along with city marketing material. Here, as part of WERE IT AS IF, a view of the 2009 billboard appeared on the screen, once every minute. At the time in 2009, the area around Rotterdam Centraal was undergoing redevelopment. Looking at the billboard now shows clearly how the urban landscape has thoroughly changed, while Billy Apple®'s enigmatic words have not lost any of their relevance. Billy Apple®, A History of the Brand (30 May-13 September 2009); Revealed/ Concealed (26 June-13 September 2009).</span></sup>Continuing and pursuing the question further, we may ask: how do contemporary practices reside? Witte de With is not an agent, it does not sell or collect artworks. Do museums, collecting institutions par excellence, feel the same responsibility as Witte de With to move forward with contemporary practices? Do collecting museums respond in the same way? Apart from a few exceptions, not really. But it is important that contemporary practices can move in and reside for the future in these containers of knowledge, even if they may be immaterial or temporary or otherwise considered as not collectible. How can they be reflected upon or researched? If that is not a task museums take on, then it must be taken on elsewhere. Where do artists with radical practices reside as current and future knowledge bases-as some of the cases of artists and works Witte de With has shown-when they disappear in oblivion, into the gaps of time, and are not being collected or in any way embraced by collecting institutions like museums?
        <sup class="hoverable"><span class="orange">22</span><span class="footnote">22. The Paper House (2001), for example, was a collaborative project by Jeanne van Heeswijk, Rolf Engelen, Siebe Thissen, Frans Vermeer, and Inbetween, consisting of a collage of documents, posters, and photographs relating to groups, movements and individuals of the Rotterdam squatting scene. The sculpture was built from panels cut out of the thick layers of posters illegally pasted on a recently demolished kiosk in the Rotterdam city centre. The collage showed the various stories of activists and artists who fought against capitalism and housing shortages, establishing their own communes, initiating campaigns, and searching for a different, perhaps better world. A zine, with copies of original documentation told the story of the squatted spaces and their social, cultural, and political context. The Paper House traveled to different inter- national cities, collecting more stories and material from local free spaces to stimulate greater public awareness and discussion on these places and issues. [squatters #1] (15 July-24 September 2001).</span></sup> There should be a firm demand to know how museum institutions think such practices could be collected and play a role in the discourse of art as a larger body.</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">Places like Witte de With then have a role to play in the afterlife of practices.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>Yes. Then the question arises: how do you bring them to the fore? Through exhibitions, of course. But then how are they disseminated to other realms so that they can be kicked around and embraced and thought through? And what do these kinds of practices mean in the context of a democratic society, why are they important?</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">The cases included in WERE IT AS IF have done what you've described, to reveal exactly what was happening, what was at stake.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>It was an attempt to answer these questions with different "proofs," different witnesses than what usually exists in the context of an exhibition. </p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="styled-question">Then that's the turn from exhibition to something else, and it's exciting to think of that "something else" as a new responsibility for places like Witte de With to undertake. Then, the "archive" of the immaterial, of the other side becomes the key location for that new responsibility.</blockquote>
